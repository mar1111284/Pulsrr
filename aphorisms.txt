Reality drags us to eternality.
Time is an illusion, lunch doubly so.
Creativity over comfort.
Silence is louder than noise.
Machines dream in static.
Oil tastes like neon.
The conveyor belt never sleeps.
Concrete whispers secrets at midnight.
The machine coughs and calls it poetry.
Rust grows faster than hope.
The factory dreams in sparks again.
Neon hums louder than my thoughts.
Oil stains are the city’s handwriting.
The conveyor belt whispers my name.
The vents scream but no one listens.
I trust gears more than people.
Static is the only honest signal.
Smoke tastes like Monday morning.

Broken wires are philosophers.
Smokestacks hum lullabies.
Rust is the new chrome.
Steam hides forgotten memories.
The metal eats the horizon.
Pipes leak wisdom in binary.
The clock melts in the assembly hall.
Hammers sing at 3 AM.
Circuit ghosts haunt the factory floor.
Sparks are industrial fireworks.
Chains rattle like jazz.
The boiler knows your secrets.
Bolts remember the hammer.
Dust collects like forgotten thoughts.
Neon bleeds into shadow.
The gears envy the screws.
